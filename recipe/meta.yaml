  summary: Restricted permutations with R
  description: |
    A set of restricted permutation designs for freely exchangeable, line transects (time series), and spatial
    grid designs plus permutation of blocks (groups of samples) is provided. 'permute' also allows split-plot designs,
    in which the whole-plots or split-plots or both can be freely-exchangeable or one of the restricted designs. The
    'permute' package is modelled after the permutation schemes of 'Canoco 3.1' (and later) by Cajo ter Braak.
